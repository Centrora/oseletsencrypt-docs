It's very easy to install OSE Let's Encrypt in the WordPress site.

1. Upload the entire ``"ose-letsencrypt"`` folder to the ``"/wp-content/plugins/"`` directory or download it through the WordPress backend.

2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** menu in WordPress backend. After that, there will be a new menu **OSE Let's Encrypt** on the side bar.
