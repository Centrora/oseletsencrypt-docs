About OSE Let's Encrypt
*******************************

OSE Let's Encrypt is an easy-to-use client software for `Let's Encrypt <https://letsencrypt.org/>`_ service which provides free SSL certificates for everyone. Have all your WordPress websites protected in easy steps now!

Using the plugin, you can quickly acquire new certificates for your site, and then switch your site into HTTPS.

The Let's Encrypt service only provides certificates that are valid for 90 days. However, they can be always renewed - no limitations there. And with this plugin you don't even need to worry about that, as the plugin will automatically renew existing certificates before they expire.
